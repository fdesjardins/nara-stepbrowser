Created a graph superclass containing most of the graphing routines. 
New graphs need to simply initialize a number of values and provide
an init and redraw method.

Implemented node selection, and tailored node movement to work with
node selection. Added selection tools in Edit menu. 

All graphs other than context have been fully updated and are working
nearly 100%. Added comments/reorganized. Various bugfixes. 

Todo:

level of detail for co-occurrence
finish clustering configuration
graph properties window
graph transformations
documentation
