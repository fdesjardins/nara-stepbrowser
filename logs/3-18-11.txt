Finished porting the clustering example from matlab to python, and graphing
confirms it's working. Some result images were saved in misc. 

Got new features into co-occurence graph, and extensively reorganized that
file. Should have the new features into context graph soon. 

Started preparing to get the clustering code to work with co-occurence. 
Should be roughly in by next commit.

Fixed node sizing issue in hierarchy graph.

Brainstorm/Todo:

clustering into co-occurence/context
clustering configuration window
see edge weights
each graph has an 'additional information' window
make node size a value entry
switch label type from names to numbers
graph editing tools
	node/edge hiding, 
	lasso/multiple select, 
	node/edge colors, 
	individual size, 
	etc
