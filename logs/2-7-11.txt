Everything has been ready to go for a week now. I'm starting to develop
the structure for the File Browser in preparation for porting it into the
Qt framework. 

So far, I've gotten the main window, and modularized the file menu and
status bar elements into their own classes. This actually took longer than
I anticipated, because of the signal-slot structure here.
