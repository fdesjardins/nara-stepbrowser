Fixed the size of the overlay to display selected nodes. Added
the ability to transform the canvas to a selected node or a 
selected graph. (same in the cases of co-occurrence and context graphs)

Node multiplier now in the correct class, and working fully. Updated
UI elements. Worked out bugs from moving to graph superclass.
