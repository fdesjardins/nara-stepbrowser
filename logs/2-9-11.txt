Spent today getting the examples to draw inside a Qt canvas. The graphtest and graphtestnumpy
examples are working. Cleaned up some interface elements, and got grid, and save plot working.

Using a combo box to select examples, currently.

Also, researched features that may be useful, such as artist picker (allows picking nodes). 

Todo: Get the examples in proper classes and call them from the matPlotFrame object during the
on_draw method. Get the STEP loading procedure in a QThread and hook it up to the status_bar
for loading progress.
