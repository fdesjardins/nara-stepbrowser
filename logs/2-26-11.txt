Spent two days working on making movable nodes. Almost there, just having an axes clearing problem.
Nodes are smart enough to know when they're being clicked now and can perform actions based on the button used.

----- a few hours later ----- 

Got node movement working. Fixed grid drawing bug, and co-occurence not setting correct step_path.
Nodes also present their names to the status bar when hovered over.

Got some weird behavior for a while, before I realized I should disconnect the mpl_connections for 
the draggableNodes. They were eating up cpu cycles and holding memory references so the gc wasn't
cleaning them up properly. Adding a simple destructor to perform these disconnects seems to have 
done the trick. 

TODO:

2) Implement a context menu for nodes
3) Dynamic adjustment of node size multiplier

4) Console dialog window
5) "Load" into file menu
6) Sidepane

7) Make breadcrumb smarter regarding window width
