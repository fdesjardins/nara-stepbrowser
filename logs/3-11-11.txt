Dynamic node size multiplier is in and working.

Migrated all new features into hierarchy graph. Fixed performance issue
involving node movement. Dynamic node label display is now available.

Opening files from the context menu now also works on Linux. Will adjust
for compatibility before next commit.

Entry to set STEP directory added to file menu.

TODO:

1a) Finish explicit clustering
1b) Clustering configuration dialog

2) Get new features into co-occurence and context graphs
3) Improve node sizing
4) Console dialog
