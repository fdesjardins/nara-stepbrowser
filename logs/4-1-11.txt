Spent the last two days debugging and mapping out my next set of goals
I want to tackle before the semester's end. 

Mainly, a long time was spent on an issue involving the automatic 
segmentation/clustering of graphs that was causing issues. However, 
it's now working well, and has been tested on a variety of STEP
files sets.

Performance has become an glaring issue, and there's only so much that
can be done about it. The original clustering algorithm in ../misc/ that
uses a lightweight ui and doesn't contain any bells/whistles I've added
even suffers once the number of files reaches over about 100. Unfortunately,
I think this is just an artifact of the many layers of Python libraries
being used.

I will look into performance improvements further, but it seems like 
the library calls are the heaviest loads in the system.
