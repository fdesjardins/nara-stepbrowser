I need to get context graph working. Currently has some dependency conflicts on my system. 



-- From Word Doc -- 

Co-occurrence is a relatively weak criterion for determining file relations. It is more accurate to consider co-occurrence as a measure of document similarity. It is not always the case that related documents are similar.

Interactivity would be a useful feature of future visualization development.
It may be useful, for instance, to explore the nature of edges between nodes. 
In our case, this would permit the user to see which terms occurred in both documents. 

It would also be helpful to permit the user to rearrange the nodes of the graph to impose a different layout on the graph, or to incorporate some prior knowledge the user may have of the data.
