Finalized step_path alteration/initialization scheme, and began designing
a breadcrumb widget to use in conjunction with a small directory
navigation pane.

Fixed bug where grid was not getting drawn every time it should. 
Added fullscreen. Organized project file structure.

TODO: 

1) Get nodes selectable, and movable
2) Implement a context menu for nodes
3) Dynamic adjustment of node size multiplier

4) Console dialog window
5) "Load" into file menu
6) Sidepane

7) Make breadcrumb smarter regarding window width
