Spent most of my time today porting over the Matlab file Dr. McGraw
gave me on Friday into Python. It has not been exactly straightforward,
mainly because Python lacks the intuitive syntax for manipulating
arrays/matrices that Matlab has.

In addition, the graphing needs to be coded manually, and there is no
eigs function available in numpy or scipy, so I'll have to do that
manually as well. Should finish it tomorrow or Monday.
