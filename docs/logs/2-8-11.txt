Finished excising the menu and status bar, and they are now working together
fine using a clever lambda function as a slot. 

Am now exporting the matplotlib and networkx routines into their own classes/widgets.
Seems to be more straight-forward than I figured it would be. Should have the pyplot
in the same state as the qt_graph_test demo by today.
