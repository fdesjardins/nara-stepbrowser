Fixed a bug where co-occurence wasn't disconnecting nodes, causing a
stuttering in the interface. 

Also, got to test the browser in Windows 7. Everything is working 
other than the color scheme being used to display edge weights in
the co-occurence graph. File opening mechanism also needs changed, 
but I knew about that. 

Added in a dialog window to allow the user the adjust the clustering results.
Going to finish trying to get co-occurence working with the clustering
code, push my changes, and switch over to Windows for a while. 

There is now a window availabe in view that displays, hopefully, useful
console messages.
